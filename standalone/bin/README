linux-x86_x64 binary
Drop in replacement for original zold_score.so

Works fine at least with some debian/ubuntu-based OS's, and with AMD GPUs - haven't had the opportunity to try it out with other stuff yet..

NO guarantees though!
If it doesn't work, you can always try the build-from-sources approach.

To run, you need functioning OpenCL environment (given that you have some GPU to utilize, all this stuff can be downloaded from either from AMD, nVidia or Intel).
