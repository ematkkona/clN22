linux-x86_x64 binary
Drop in replacement for original zold_score.so

Works fine at least with some debian/ubuntu-based OS's, and with AMD GPUs - haven't had the opportunity to try it out with other stuff yet..

NO guarantees though!
I'd recommend building from sources on your system.

To run, you need functioning OpenCL environment (given that you have some GPU to utilize, all this stuff can be downloaded from either from AMD, nVidia or Intel).
